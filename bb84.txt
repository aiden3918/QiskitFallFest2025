BB84 is a quantum encryption algorithm that allows two parties to create a secure encryption by utilizing the quantum nature of qubits to detect eavesdroppers.
One of the problems of classicaly encryption algorithms is that none are truly secure. While some may be very secure, they can still fall victim to brute-force attacks. The nature of quantum encryption is different. By utilizing the random nature of qubits (probabilities, no-cloning theorem), quantum key distribution (QKD) can design a system that is secure in a way that is much harder for classical computers to keep up with.
Another problem of classical encryption is that their models can be easily exploited using quantum computers. By developing quantum encryption algorithms, we would be able to keep our information secret in the quantum age.
Another example of a QKD algorithm is E91, which relies on Alice and Bob to have two entangled quantum states. Both Alice and Bob can measure with the same basis and get the exact same answer. However, if a third-party is eavesdropping, similar to BB84, Alice and Bob will be able to detect this.
This is one of the similarities between BB84 and E91; both rely on the states of the qubits to determine whether or not there is an eavesdropper. Another is that both utilize the idea of a "quantum" key to share information. One difference is that BB84 does not entangle any qubits; E91 does. Either way, both use the principles of quantum mechanics to create new ways to check and establish a secure connection.
